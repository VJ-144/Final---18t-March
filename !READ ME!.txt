INSTRUCTIONS

4 Text files are required for this program

The program can ONLY be run through the play button after changing the run configuration.

To do this go to:
		-> Run
		-> Configuration per file...
		
		Enter all file names with spacing between in the order mentioned below. This will allow
		the simulation to run via the green run button.


1st File ---> 	1-System_Parameters.txt
		
		The required inputs for this file are:
		
		Number of Planets: The number of objects in the simulation, this inclues the Sun
				   and must be larger than 1.
		dt: The timesteps being used.
		Step: The number of interations the program will run for.
		Allowed_Values: Allows the size of the VMD file to be controlled, planet positional data for multiplies
		of this number will be printed to the VMD file
		
		NOTE: The values of dt and Step must be changed to the correct ratio, at least 5
		      waves should be visable on the energy flucuation graph for an accurate simulation.


2nd File --->	2-Initial_Conditions.txt
		
		This includes all the starting position, velocity, mass and object names in the simulation.
		It is formated as: <Planet Name> <m> <x1> <x2> <x3> <v1> <v2> <v3> per line.
		where xi and vi represent components of position and velocity.
		
		All the Moons of planets should be placed after the planet they orbit. They must all also be named "Moon",
		the capitalisation of "M" is important.
		
		The units used in the program are kg, AU and days, the input data must reflect this.


3rd File ---> 	3-VMD_Data.txt
		
		This is the output positional data for all planets in XYZ format. The file is for the 
		simulation of the system on VMD. The iteration values printed to this file can
		be controlled by the Allowed_Values parameter in 1-System Parameters.txt


4th File --->	4-Observables_Data.txt

		This includes all simulated data generated from programme. It includes the planets/moons apsides
		and periods. It also includes the systems global properties such as total kinetic energy, total
		potential energy, total energy, energy fluctuation and simulation length.

		Units for Apsides are AU, periods are days, simulation length is years and all energies are in joules
